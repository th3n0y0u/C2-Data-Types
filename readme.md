## Data Types

We will be working with five main data types
1. Integer - whole number
2. String - a collection of characters
3. Char - 1 character
4. Float - decimal number
5. Boolean - True/False (1/0)

## Variables

` somerandomWord = "IDK"

Variable: container, holds a value

### Rule for variable names

1. Always starts with a letter
`1name = "IDK" --> NOT ALLOWED

2. Can only contain numbers, ketters, and underscores (_)

`my name = "IDK" --> NOT ALLOWED

3. If more than one word, use camelCase or underscores to separate words

`myFirstName` `my_First_Name`
